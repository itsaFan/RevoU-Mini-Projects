## Brief Description

#### Project Theme
Good Health & Well Being

#### Project Purpose:
Anyone, either they are a teenager, young adult, or adult sometimes face many significant challenges in their lifetime. This increases the chance of various mental health issues. Since mental health issues are diverse and complex, individuals who struggle with any mental health issues sometimes find themselves isolated and struggle to find a safe space where they can share their experiences freely, seek advice, or receive empathy from others who faced the same issue. We understand that professional help is the most important and irreplaceable, but seeking advice or support from those who share the same experiences or tips provides a different layer of understanding and comfort.
